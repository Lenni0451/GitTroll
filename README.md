# GitTroll
GitTroll is a Trolling/Griefing Plugin based on Spigot 1.8.8. It is also my first test to correctly work with the git software.

### Contribute
If you want to contribute keep the added code in the same style as the existing one and mark changes so they can be easily identified.

### Compiling
If you can't wait until an official release download and import the project into eclipse. You have to add the spigot 1.8.8 jar as a dependency.
Check out the [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/buildtools/#1-8-8) website for a tutorial how to build spigot.

### ToDo
 - Implementing some basic commands
 - Releasing a official release
